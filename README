# sgicdindex

This is a simple program to build the index page at [https://jrra.zone/sgi].
It takes data from the SQLite database sgi.db and generates index.html.

The most interesting thing about this project for you, dear reader, is
probably the data stored within the database, and not the code to generate the
index page.

## Building

You will need a C compiler and the SQLite3 library. Optionally, install
xmllint to verify XML correctness. Then, run `make`. The index page will be
written to index.html.
